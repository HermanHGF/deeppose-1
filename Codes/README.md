### DeepPose Original
This model is the same as the model in the paper. But takes too long to train without a GPU.


### MiniDeepPose - Recommended
This model is a minimized version of the original model. It is useful to check if the system runs or for a quick result.
Also I added up the model trained through 319000 iterations.
